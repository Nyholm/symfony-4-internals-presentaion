# Symfony 4 internals

This is the preparation for the Symfony 4 internals talk. Im basically building a new framework and trying to be smart
in highlighting symfony features without mentioning symfony. 


### After building of framework

We still have some problems: 

* Show toolbar when exception. => We need multiple "loops". Ei Symfony event dispatcher
* Third party support => Bundles
* Authentication (We only mentioned authorization)
* CLI => Just a new (slightly different) event loop.
